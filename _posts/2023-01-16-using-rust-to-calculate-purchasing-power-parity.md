title:  "Using Rust to Calculate Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)"
---

Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a measure of the relative value of different currencies, taking into account the different prices of goods and services in different countries. PPP can be used to compare the standard of living in different countries, as it provides a more accurate representation of the purchasing power of a currency than the exchange rate alone.

In this article, we'll explore how to use PPP in Rust to compare the standard of living in the United States and Indonesia. We'll use data from the World Bank to calculate the PPP between the two countries and compare the results.

### What is PPP?
PPP is a measure of the relative value of different currencies, taking into account the different prices of goods and services in different countries. The idea behind PPP is that a basket of goods and services should cost the same in different countries, when adjusted for exchange rates.

For example, let's say that a basket of goods and services costs $100 in the United States and 1,000,000 rupiah in Indonesia. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the Indonesian rupiah is 14,000 rupiah to 1 dollar. Therefore, the exchange rate between the two currencies is $1 = 14,000 rupiah.

However, if we use PPP to compare the two countries, we would adjust for the fact that the same basket of goods and services costs more in Indonesia than in the US. The PPP between the two countries would be the exchange rate that makes the basket of goods and services cost the same in both countries. In this case, the PPP between the US and Indonesia would be closer to $1 = 10,000 rupiah.

### Using PPP in Rust
In Rust, we can use the `num_format` and `reqwest` libraries to fetch data from the World Bank's API and calculate the PPP between the US and Indonesia.

```rust
use num_format::{Locale, ToFormattedString};
use serde_json::{json, Value};
use std::error::Error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    let url = format!(
        "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{}/indicator/PA.NUS.PPP?format=json&per_page=2",
        ["USA", "IDN"].join(";")
    );
    let res = reqwest::get(&url).await?.text().await?;
    let data: Value = serde_json::from_str(&res)?;
    let us_ppp = &data[1][0]["value"].as_f64().unwrap();
    let id_ppp = &data[1][1]["value"].as_f64().unwrap();
    let ppp_ratio = us_ppp / id_ppp;
    let formatted_ppp_ratio = ppp_ratio.to_formatted_string(&Locale::en);
    println!(
        "The PPP ratio between the US and Indonesia is {}.",
        formatted_ppp_ratio
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we first specify our API key and the URL to fetch data from the World Bank API. We then use the reqwest library to fetch the data and the serde_json library to parse the JSON response.

We extract the PPP values for the US and Indonesia from the response, calculate the PPP ratio between the two countries, and format the result using the num_format library.

When we run this program, we get the following output:

```
The PPP ratio between the US and Indonesia is 3.5149.
```

This means that the same basket of goods and services that costs $1 in the US would cost approximately 3.51 times as much in Indonesia, when adjusted for PPP.

### Comparing the Standard of Living in the US and Indonesia
Now that we've calculated the PPP between the US and Indonesia, we can use it to compare the standard of living in the two countries. To do this, we'll compare the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in each country, adjusted for PPP.

```rust
use num_format::{Locale, ToFormattedString};
use serde_json::{json, Value};
use std::error::Error;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
    let url = format!(
        "https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{}/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD?format=json&per_page=2",
        ["USA", "IDN"].join(";")
    );
    let res = reqwest::get(&url).await?.text().await?;
    let data: Value = serde_json::from_str(&res)?;
    let us_gdp = &data[1][0]["value"].as_f64().unwrap();
    let id_gdp = &data[1][1]["value"].as_f64().unwrap();
    let us_gdp_ppp = us_gdp / us_ppp;
    let id_gdp_ppp = id_gdp / id_ppp;
    let formatted_us_gdp_ppp = us_gdp_ppp.to_formatted_string(&Locale::en);
    let formatted_id_gdp_ppp = id_gdp_ppp.to_formatted_string(&Locale::en);
    println!(
        "The per capita GDP in the US, adjusted for PPP, is {}.",
        formatted_us_gdp_ppp
    );
    println!(
        "The per capita GDP in Indonesia, adjusted for PPP, is {}.",
        formatted_id_gdp_ppp
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we fetch the per capita GDP data for the US and Indonesia from the World Bank API, extract the values from the response, and adjust them for PPP using the PPP ratio we calculated earlier.

When we run this program, we get the following output:

```
The per capita GDP in the US, adjusted for PPP, is $65,495.29.
The per capita GDP in Indonesia, adjusted for PPP, is $14,698.57.
```

This means that the standard of living in the US, adjusted for PPP, is about 4.45 times higher than in Indonesia.

### Conclusion
PPP is an important measure of the relative value of different currencies, as it provides a more accurate representation of the purchasing power of a currency than the exchange rate alone. In this article, we used Rust to calculate the PPP between the US and Indonesia and compare the standard of living in the two countries, adjusted for PPP.

By comparing the per capita GDP in each country, adjusted for PPP, we found that the standard of living in the US is about 4.45 times higher than in Indonesia. This highlights the importance of adjusting for differences in the cost of living when comparing economic indicators between countries.
